        <h1>Land Prevention Techniques</h1>

        <p>
            Reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides can help in preventing land pollution. 
            In addition to contaminating the soil, they also do no good to the crops. Therefore, farmers must use 
            natural ingredients instead of these harmful toxins.

<h3>Conservation Tillage</h3>

        <p>
            This is a technique that involves leaving crop residues on the
soil surface to protect it from erosion. It can also involve using minimum tillage or
no-till techniques to reduce soil disturbance.

              <h3>Afforestation</h3>
        
        <img src="afforestation.jpg" width="500">
       
        
       
        
        <p>
            The government has launched several afforestation programs such as
            the National Afforestation Program and the Green India Mission to promote tree
            planting and forest conservation. Afforestation helps to prevent soil erosion by
            reducing runoff and providing a protective cover for the soil.

              <h3>Agroforesty</h3>

              <p>
                This is a land use management system that combines trees and crops
on the same land to improve soil health, water conservation, and biodiversity.

                    <h3>Wild Breaks</h3>

                    <p>
                        Windbreaks are rows of trees or shrubs planted along the edges of
                        fields to reduce wind erosion.
                          </p>
                    

                          <h3>Cover Crops</h3>

                    <p>Cover crops are grown between main crops to protect the soil from
                        erosion and improve soil fertility.
                          </p>



                          <h2>Watershed Development</h2>
                          <img src="watershed.jpg" width="500">

                          <p>
                            The Government of India has implemented a national
Watershed Development Program to improve soil and water conservation. This
program aims to promote the adoption of conservation techniques such as contour
trenching, vegetative barriers, and check dams.

                          <h3>Terracing</h3>
        
                          <img src="terrace farming.jpg" width="500">
                         
                          
                         
                          
                          <p>
                            Terracing involves building small walls or steps on hillsides to slow down
the flow of water and reduce erosion.
