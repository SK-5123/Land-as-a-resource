        <h1>Soil Types </h1>
        <p>Soil is a natural resource that can be categorised into different soil types, each with distinct characteristics that 
        provide growing benefits and limitations. Identifying the type of soil you require for a project is paramount to support the healthy growth of plant life.</p>

<h2>Types Of Soil</h2>

<hr><hr>


<h3>Clay SOil</h3>
        
        <img src="clay soil.jpg" width="500">
       
        
       
        
        <p>
            Clay Soil is a heavy soil type that benefits from high nutrients. Clay soils remain wet and cold in winter and dry out in summer.
            These soils are made of over 25 percent clay, and because of the spaces found between clay particles, clay soils hold a high 
            amount of water.

              </p>


              <h3>Sandy SOil</h3>
        
        <img src="sandy soil.jpg" width="500">
       
        
       
        
        <p>
            Sandy Soil is light, warm, dry and tends to be acidic and low in nutrients. Sandy soils are often known as light soils due 
            to their high proportion of sand and little clay (clay weighs more than sand). These soils have quick water drainage and are
             easy to work with. They are quicker to warm up in spring than clay soils but tend to dry out in summer and suffer from low
              nutrients that are washed away by rain.
              </p>
        
              <h3>Silt SOil</h3>
        
              <img src="silt soil.jpg" width="500">
             
              
             
              
              <p>
                Silt Soil is a light and moisture retentive soil type with a high fertility rating.
                As silt soils compromise of medium sized particles they are well drained and hold moisture well.
                As the particles are fine, they can be easily compacted and are prone to washing away with rain.
                    </p>
              
                    <h3>Peat Soil</h3>
        
                    <img src="peat soil.jpg" width="500">
                   
                    
                   
                    
                    <p>
                        Peat soil is high in organic matter and retains a large amount of moisture. This type of soil is very rarely
                         found in a garden and often imported into a garden to provide an optimum soil base for planting.
                       </p>
                    

                          <h3>Chalk SOil</h3>
        
                    <img src="chalk soil.jpg" width="500">
                   
                    
                   
                    
                    <p>
                        Chalk soil can be either light or heavy but always highly alkaline due to the calcium carbonate (lime) within its 
                        structure. As these soils are alkaline they will not support the growth of ericaceous plants that require acidic
                         soils to grow.
                          </p>


                          <h3>Loam SOil</h3>
                          <img src="loam soil.jpg" width="500">
                    <p>Loam soil is a mixture of sand, silt and clay that are combined to avoid the negative effects of each type. These soils 
                        are fertile, easy to work with and provide good drainage. Depending on their predominant composition they can be either
                         sandy or clay loam.
                          </p>
